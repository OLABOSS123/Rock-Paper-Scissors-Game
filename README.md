# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) is a simple hand game for two players used for quick decision-making. Players simultaneously choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Rock crushes Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock. It's a game of chance and timing based on these three winning/losing relationships.
